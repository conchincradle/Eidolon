# Eidolon

This software was written in python 2.7.6 (32 bit) on a Windows 7 machine.<br/>
It relies heavily on numpy, version 1.8.1 and on PILLOW (PIL), version 1.1.7.

It is a translation of software written in the Processing language 
(see https://processing.org/) by <a href="http://www.gestaltrevision.be/en/about-us/contact/all-contacts/45">Jan Koenderink</a>.

The original as well as a matlab version (by Matteo Valsecchi) can be found 
here: www.allpsych.uni-giessen.de/EidolonFactories/index.htm.

A manual from the original software is available in the manual folder (PDF).
